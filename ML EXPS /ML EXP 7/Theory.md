*Aim:*  
To implement Hebbian Learning algorithms for a given sample data.

*Theory:*  
Hebbian network is a single layer neural network which consists of one input layer with many input units and one output layer with one output unit.  
The architecture is usually used for pattern classification.

*Hebbian learning algorithm:*  
1. Set all weight to 0, wi = 0 for i = 1 to n, b (bias) to zero.  
2. For each input vector s (input vector), t (target output pair), repeat steps 3 to 5:  
3. Set activations for input units with the input vectors xi = si for i = 1 to n.  
4. Set the corresponding output value to the output neuron i.e., y = t.  
5. Update weight & bias by applying Hebbian rule for i = 1 to n:  
   - wi(new) = wi(old) + xi * y  
   - b(new) = b(old) + y

*Conclusion:*  
Thus, we have successfully studied & implemented Hebbian learning using customer segmentation dataset.# Experiment No: 6
