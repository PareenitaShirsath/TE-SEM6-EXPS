# IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM)

## AIM

To implement the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for a given dataset and analyze its performance.

## THEORY

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. The equation for the decision boundary is:

\[ w \cdot x + b = 0 \]

Where:
- \( w \) is the weight vector,
- \( x \) represents input features,
- \( b \) is the bias term.

SVM aims to maximize the margin between data points and the decision boundary, improving generalization. It also supports kernel functions to handle non-linearly separable data.

Common applications of SVM include image recognition, text classification, and bioinformatics.
SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It finds the optimal **hyperplane** that best separates the data points of different classes. The main objective is to maximize the **margin**, which is the distance between the closest data points (support vectors) and the decision boundary:

\[
w \cdot x + b = 0
\]

where \( w \) is the weight vector, \( x \) is the input feature, and \( b \) is the bias term.

SVM can handle **non-linearly separable data** by using **kernel functions** such as the **RBF kernel** or **polynomial kernel**.

### Applications:
- Image classification
- Text categorization
- Face detection

## CONCLUSION

SVM is a robust algorithm that excels at handling high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships using kernel functions. It is effective for classification problems but can be computationally expensive for large datasets. Choosing the right kernel and tuning hyperparameters are crucial for optimal performance.
