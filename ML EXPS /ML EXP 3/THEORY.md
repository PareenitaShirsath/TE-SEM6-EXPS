## AIM

To implement the Linear Regression algorithm for a given dataset and analyze its performance.

## THEORY

Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predictive analysis. It establishes a relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The mathematical equation for simple linear regression is:

\[ y = mx + c \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable,
- \( x \) is the independent variable,
- \( m \) is the slope of the line,
- \( c \) is the intercept.

For multiple linear regression, the equation extends to:

\[ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n \]

Where \( b_0, b_1, ..., b_n \) are the coefficients determined by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE).

Linear Regression is widely used in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing for trend prediction, risk analysis, and demand forecasting.

## CONCLUSION

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for predictive modeling. It provides insights into the relationships between variables and is computationally efficient for small to medium-sized datasets. However, it assumes linearity between features and the target variable, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios. Proper feature selection and data preprocessing can enhance the model's effectiveness.
