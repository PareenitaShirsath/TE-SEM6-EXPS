# Experiment No. 7

## 1. Aim:
To study and implement Identity and Access Management (IAM) practices on AWS.

## 2. Theory:
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which resources AWS users can access.

IAM has a variety of features. It provides shared access to your AWS account, allowing you to grant different permissions to different users and resources. IAM offers the necessary infrastructure to control authentication and authorization for your AWS account.

Implementing IAM practices on AWS involves creating and managing IAM users, groups, roles, policies, and other components to control access to AWS resources securely. IAM is critical for ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources and for applying the principle of least privilege.

## 3. Key Features:
- **User Management**: Create and manage users with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- **Group Management**: Manage permissions for multiple users by applying a set of permissions to groups.
- **Policies and Permissions**: Attach policies to users, groups, or roles to specify what actions they are allowed or denied on AWS resources.
- **IAM Access Analyzer**: Helps identify resources in your AWS environment that are shared with external principals.
- **Access Control for AWS Services**: Ensures that only authorized users and services have access to AWS resources.

## 4. Conclusion:
Thus, we have successfully studied and implemented Identity and Access Management (IAM) practices on AWS.
