# Experiment No: 1

## Aim:
To study and implement creating and running virtual machines on Hosted Hypervisor like Virtual Box and KVM.

## Theory:
Hosted Virtualization is a fundamental cloud computing concept that offers a versatile approach to managing virtual machines (VMs).

### Virtual Box:
- It is an open-source hosted hypervisor.
- Operates as an application within the host OS.
- Its user-friendly interface simplifies the process of creating, configuring, and managing VMs.

### KVM:
- Kernel-based Virtual Machine, a Linux Kernel module.
- Transforms the host OS into a hypervisor.
- Unlike VirtualBox, integrates directly into the Linux Kernel.
- Includes command-line tools and a library for management, providing participants with insights into Linux-based virtualization.

## Conclusion:
Thus, we have successfully implemented creating and running virtual machines on Hosted Hypervisor like Virtual Box and KVM.
