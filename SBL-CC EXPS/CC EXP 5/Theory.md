# **Experiment No. 5**  
## **Database as a Service (DBaaS) on SQL/NOSQL Databases like AWS RDS**  

### **1. Aim:**  
To study and implement Database as a Service (DBaaS) on SQL/NOSQL databases like AWS RDS.  

### **2. Theory:**  
1. **Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)** is a **web service** that simplifies the process of setting up, operating, and scaling a relational database in the AWS Cloud.  
2. It provides **cost-efficient, resizable capacity** for industry-standard relational databases and automates common database administration tasks.  

### **3. Key Features of DBaaS:**  
- The **DBaaS model** is ideal for **small to medium-sized businesses**.  
- Offloading database service and maintenance to the **DBaaS provider** allows businesses to implement applications they otherwise could not afford to build and support on-premises.  
- **Database as a Service (DBaaS)** is a cloud computing managed service that provides access to a database **without requiring**:  
  - Physical hardware setup  
  - Software installation  
  - Manual configuration of the database  

### **4. Advantages of DBaaS:**  
- **Reduced Management Requirements**: Automates database setup, patching, and backups.  
- **Elimination of Physical Infrastructure**: No need for on-premises database servers.  
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces **hardware costs** and eliminates the need for database hardware upgrades.  

### **5. Disadvantages of Cloud Database:**  
- **Security Risks:**  
  - The ease of access to cloud services can expose vulnerabilities, making cloud databases potential targets for cyber threats.  
- **Limited Control:**  
  - Customers can **only manage applications, data, and services** but not the **backend infrastructure**.  

### **6. Conclusion:**  
We have successfully studied and implemented Database as a Service (DBaaS) on SQL/NoSQL databases like AWS RDS.
