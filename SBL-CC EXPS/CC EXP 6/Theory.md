# Experiment No. 6

## 1. Aim:
To study and implement Security as a Service on AWS/Azure.

## 2. Objectives:
To understand the security practices available in public cloud platforms and to demonstrate various threat detection using GuardDuty in AWS.

## 3. Theory:
Amazon GuardDuty offers threat detection enabling you to continuously monitor and protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). GuardDuty analyzes continuous metadata streams generated from your account and network activity found in:

- AWS CloudTrail Events
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs
- Domain Name System (DNS) Logs

### Features:
- GuardDuty also uses integrated threat intelligence such as known malicious IP addresses, anomaly detection, and machine learning (ML) to more accurately identify threats.
- The service is fully managed with integrated threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and ML.
- Amazon GuardDuty delivers detailed and actionable alerts that are easy to integrate with existing event management and workflow systems.
- There are no upfront costs, and you pay only for the events analyzed.
- It can continuously monitor multiple accounts at the same time without added cost and complexity.
- It strengthens security through automation by automatically responding to threat detection.
- It can remediate actions by leveraging Amazon CloudWatch Events and other services.

## 4. Conclusion:
We have successfully studied and implemented Security as a Service on AWS (Amazon GuardDuty).
