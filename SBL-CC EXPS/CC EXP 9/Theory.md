# Experiment No. 9

## 1. Aim:
To study and implement container orchestration in Kubernetes.

## 2. Theory:
Container orchestration is the process of automating the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers throughout their lifecycle. This is crucial for enterprises that need to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of containers and hosts. Container orchestration tools provide a framework for managing containers and microservices architecture at scale, making it easier to deploy the same application across different environments without redesigning it.

## 3. Features:
Container orchestration automates and manages tasks such as:
- **Provisioning and Deployment**: Automatically deploy containers to the appropriate hosts.
- **Configuration and Scheduling**: Define and manage the configuration of containers.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate resources efficiently among containers.
- **Container Availability**: Ensure containers are available and running.
- **Load Balancing and Traffic Routing**: Distribute traffic across containers to ensure stability and performance.

## 4. Orchestration Process:
- **Defining Configuration**: Specify container images, storage, network connections, and versioning.
- **Scheduling Deployment**: Deploy containers to the best host based on available resources.
- **Managing Lifecycle**: Handle scalability, load balancing, resource allocation, and health monitoring.

## 5. Advantages:
Benefits of container orchestration:
- Automatic scaling
- Improves resource utilization
- High availability and fault tolerance for applications
- Cross-environment portability
- Consistent security policies

## 6. Conclusion:
Thus, we have successfully studied and implemented container orchestration in Kubernetes.
