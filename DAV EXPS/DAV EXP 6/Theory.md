# **Text Analytics: Implementation of Spam Filter/Sentiment Analysis in Python/R**

## **Hardware / Software Required**
- **Programming Language**: Python / R  
- **Software**: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook / RStudio  

## **Theory**

### **Spam Filtering**
Spam filtering is the process of classifying emails or messages into "spam" and "not spam." This classification is achieved through machine learning techniques that analyze various features of the text.

#### **Key Components:**
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a labeled dataset of emails indicating whether they are spam or not.  
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean the text by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization.  
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text into a numerical format using techniques like **Bag of Words (BoW)** or **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.  
4. **Model Training**: Use a classification algorithm (e.g., **Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines**) to train the model on the extracted features.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

### **Sentiment Analysis**
Sentiment analysis determines the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, categorizing it as **positive, negative, or neutral**. It is widely used for monitoring social media, analyzing customer feedback, and conducting market research.

#### **Key Components:**
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of texts (e.g., reviews, tweets) labeled with sentiments.  
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean the text to prepare it for analysis.  
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text into numerical formats using **TF-IDF** or **word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec)**.  
4. **Model Training**: Select and train a classification model (e.g., **Logistic Regression, Random Forest**) on the processed data.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using metrics such as **accuracy and confusion matrix**.
