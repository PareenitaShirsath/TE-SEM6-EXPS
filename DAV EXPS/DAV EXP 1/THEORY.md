## Experiment 1: Getting Introduced to Data Analytics Libraries in Python and R

### Aim
To understand and explore various data analytics libraries available in Python and R.

### Theory
Data analytics involves processing raw data to extract meaningful insights and aid decision-making. Python and R are two widely used programming languages for data analytics due to their extensive libraries and tools.

- **Python Libraries:**
  - **Pandas:** Provides data structures and functions for data manipulation.
  - **NumPy:** Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn:** Offers machine learning tools for predictive analytics.
  
- **R Libraries:**
  - **ggplot2:** A powerful data visualization package.
  - **dplyr:** Facilitates data manipulation and transformation.
  - **tidyr:** Helps in organizing and cleaning data.
  - **caret:** Provides tools for machine learning and model training.

Both Python and R have their unique strengths. Python is preferred for general-purpose programming and scalability, while R excels in statistical analysis and visualization.

### Conclusion
Understanding the fundamental libraries in Python and R is essential for effective data analysis. Python is widely used for its versatility and ease of integration, while R is favored for its statistical capabilities. Mastering these libraries enables efficient data handling, analysis, and visualization.
