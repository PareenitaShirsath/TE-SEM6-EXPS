# Implementation of a Product Cipher using Substitution and Transposition Ciphers

## Theory

A **Product Cipher** is a type of encryption that combines multiple ciphers to enhance security. It generally involves two fundamental techniques:

1. **Substitution Cipher** - This replaces elements of the plaintext with corresponding ciphertext elements based on a fixed rule. Examples include:
   - Caesar Cipher
   - Playfair Cipher
   - Vigen√®re Cipher
   - Monoalphabetic and Polyalphabetic ciphers

2. **Transposition Cipher** - This involves rearranging the order of plaintext symbols without changing their values. Examples include:
   - Rail Fence Cipher
   - Columnar Transposition
   - Permutation-based ciphers

### Working of Product Cipher
A product cipher applies **both substitution and transposition** sequentially to encrypt the plaintext. The combination increases complexity, making cryptanalysis more challenging.

Example Steps:
1. Apply a substitution cipher (e.g., shift each letter by 3 positions).
2. Perform transposition (e.g., rearrange text based on a predefined key).
3. The final output is an encrypted message that is harder to break than individual ciphers.

## Conclusion

The implementation of a **Product Cipher** enhances security by combining substitution and transposition techniques. This approach makes it difficult for attackers to decrypt the ciphertext using simple frequency analysis or pattern recognition. By integrating multiple encryption methods, product ciphers provide a robust foundation for modern cryptographic systems.
