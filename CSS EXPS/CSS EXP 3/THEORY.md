Implementation of Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm
Theory
The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm is a cryptographic method that enables two parties to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. It was developed by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 and is widely used in secure communication protocols, including TLS, SSH, and VPNs.

The algorithm is based on the mathematical concept of modular exponentiation and the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. It allows two parties, typically called Alice and Bob, to generate a common secret key without transmitting it directly.

Working Principle
Selection of Public Parameters:

A large prime number p (modulus) and a primitive root g (base) are selected. These values are publicly shared.
Private Key Selection:

Alice selects a private key (a), and Bob selects a private key (b). These are kept secret.
Computation of Public Keys:

Alice computes her public key:
𝐴
=
𝑔
𝑎
m
o
d
 
 
𝑝
A=g 
a
 modp
Bob computes his public key:
𝐵
=
𝑔
𝑏
m
o
d
 
 
𝑝
B=g 
b
 modp
Both public keys (A and B) are exchanged over the insecure channel.
Computation of Shared Secret Key:

Alice computes the shared key using Bob’s public key:
𝑆
=
𝐵
𝑎
m
o
d
 
 
𝑝
S=B 
a
 modp
Bob computes the shared key using Alice’s public key:
𝑆
=
𝐴
𝑏
m
o
d
 
 
𝑝
S=A 
b
 modp
Since modular exponentiation is commutative, both computations yield the same secret key S, which can then be used for further encryption.
Security Aspects
The security of the algorithm relies on the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), which is computationally hard to solve.
Even though p, g, A, and B are transmitted publicly, an attacker cannot easily determine the private keys a or b due to the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms.
Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM) is a potential risk if authentication mechanisms are not implemented.
Conclusion
The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm is a fundamental cryptographic technique for securely establishing a shared key over an insecure network. It is widely used in modern security protocols such as SSL/TLS, SSH, and IPsec to protect online communications. However, authentication mechanisms must be integrated to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The algorithm’s security is based on the difficulty of solving the Discrete Logarithm Problem, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to derive the private keys under normal conditions.
